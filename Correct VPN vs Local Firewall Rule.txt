Correct VPN vs Local Firewall Rule Evaluation Logic:
Local Firewall Rules will be used when:

Source's or part's of Source location match destination's or part's of Destination location, regardless of useVpn status.

Either source or destination is not in useVpn: true.

Destination is any and source is from a known location.

VPN Rules will be used only when:

Source's or part's of Source location don't match destination's or part's of Destination location and the items that don't match in condition 1 are  in useVpn: true.
